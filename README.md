# ORBIT

Well, I always wanted to do this in 3D, but I guess Ill settle for my 2D version for now. All you do is put in the degree to start of at, and the velocity. That's all there is to it. 
For a simple orbit, use an angle of 270 and a velocity of 5.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
